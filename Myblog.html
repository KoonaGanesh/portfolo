          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hi, my name is Samala Rahul. currently I'm Learning a JAVA FULL STACK Course in JSPIDERS. and I'm excited to share my journey with you.

            Outside of school, I love to spend time exploring new hobbies and interests. Some of my current favorites include photography, and trying out new recipes. I find that these activities help me unwind and recharge after a busy week of classes and assignments.
            
            One of my biggest passions is volunteering in my local community. I've had the opportunity to work with several organizations over the years, including a local food bank and a community center for at-risk youth. Being able to give back in some small way has been incredibly rewarding and has taught me so much about empathy, compassion, and the importance of kindness.
            
            I'm also a bit of a travel enthusiast and have been fortunate enough to visit some amazing places around the world. One of my favorite trips was a backpacking adventure through Kerala,Tiruchanur where I got to experience new cultures, try new foods, and meet incredible people along the way.
            
            In this blog, I hope to share more about my experiences as a student, my adventures exploring new hobbies and interests, and my thoughts on topics that matter to me.<br> Thank you for joining me on this journey! .</p>
